# countdown-timer
This Python script implements a simple countdown timer. The user can specify the duration in seconds, and the timer will count down to zero, displaying the remaining time in minutes and seconds format. This can be a useful utility for timing tasks, managing work intervals, or any other scenario where a countdown timer is needed
